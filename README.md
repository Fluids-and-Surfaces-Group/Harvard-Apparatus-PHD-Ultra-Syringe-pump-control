# Harvard-Apparatus-PHD-Ultra-Syringe-pump-control

I have made a package (bonjour_pompe.zip) of matlab functions to control the Harvard pump remotely, along with a code designed to make sine functions. Note that you need to put the pump on the Infuse/Withdraw quickstart method and connect through usb, as well as check which COM port you use. To do that, you can check it in your device manager when the pump is plugged in, or use the software in Pump Applications/Pump Terminal of the Harvard zip package (also on the cloud, I was sent it by the support).
